My Homelab Setup
This repository contains the docker-compose.yml file and configuration instructions for my personal homelab. The goal of this setup is to run various self-hosted services on a local network, accessible via easy-to-remember .local domain names instead of IP addresses and port numbers.

This entire stack is managed by Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

Core Components
The setup relies on two key services for network management:

AdGuard Home: Acts as a network-wide DNS server. Its primary jobs are to block ads and trackers and, most importantly, to resolve our custom .local domains (e.g., n8n.local) to the homelab server's IP address.

Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM): Acts as a reverse proxy. It receives all web traffic and, based on the requested domain name, forwards it to the correct application container. This is what allows us to use standard web ports (80/443) for all services without exposing their individual ports.

üöÄ Initial Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your Docker host machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/homelab.git
cd homelab

Step 2: Free Up Port 53
Before starting, you must disable the default systemd-resolved stub listener on the host machine.

# Edit the configuration file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

# Uncomment and set DNSStubListener=no
DNSStubListener=no

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

Step 3: Launch the Stack
Start all services using Docker Compose:

docker compose up -d

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
After launching the stack, you must configure AdGuard Home and Nginx Proxy Manager.

Part 1: Configure AdGuard Home (The Address Book)
Access the Setup Wizard: Open your browser to http://<your_server_ip>:3000.

Complete the Wizard: Follow the on-screen instructions to create your admin user and password. The default port settings are fine.

Add DNS Rewrites: This is the most important step. In the AdGuard dashboard, navigate to Filters -> DNS rewrites.

Click "Add DNS rewrite" for each service you want to access via a local domain. Replace 192.168.1.101 with your server's actual local IP address.

adguard.local

192.168.1.101

npm.local

192.168.1.101

portainer.local

192.168.1.101

n8n.local

192.168.1.101

stirling.local

192.168.1.101

omni.local

192.168.1.101

Configure Your Router: Log in to your home router's admin page and find the DHCP/LAN settings. Set the Primary DNS Server to your homelab server's IP address. This will make all devices on your network use AdGuard Home automatically. You may need to restart your devices for them to pick up the new DNS server.

Part 2: Configure Nginx Proxy Manager (The Traffic Cop)
Access the Admin UI: Open your browser to http://<your_server_ip>:81 (or http://npm.local:81 once DNS is working).

First-Time Login: Log in with the default credentials and change them immediately.

Email: admin@example.com

Password: changeme

Create Proxy Hosts: In the dashboard, go to Hosts -> Proxy Hosts and click "Add Proxy Host". Create an entry for each service according to the table below. For the SSL tab on each entry, select "None".
